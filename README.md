# Word-Counter
This project was inspired by Vsauce's "The Zipf Mystery" (https://youtu.be/fCn8zs912OE). This program reads a text file,
counts up every unique word, and prints the results to a seperate page. It's interesting to see Zipf's law in action. THe only
exception is the Gettysburg Address, but I think that's because it's so short. Take a look at Beowulf, War and Peace, or some other text.
I recommend trying another book from Project Gutenburg (https://www.gutenberg.org/), as that's where I got my texts.
